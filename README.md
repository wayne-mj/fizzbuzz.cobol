## Fizzbuzz written in COBOL

My attempt at writing Fizzbuzz in COBOL.

Do not ask.  It was a learning exercise also to reacquaint myself with an old forgotten friend called COBOL.

Except, the main function required to complete the process Modulo is not implemented in GNUCobol for some reason even though it is documented, at least it is 'Not Defined' as far as the compiler is concerned.

So I had to learn how to cobble together an alternative.  But when the string were no concatenating because intellisense kept trying to take over all the time - that was rather annoying.

It finally works.  

What have I learnt:
- COBOL is fun,
- COBOL is a bitch,
- I really wish I had put the time in when I had the opportunity and the youth to learn.  

At the end of the day, this was a thrill: researching, coding, debugging, swearing, and repeat.
